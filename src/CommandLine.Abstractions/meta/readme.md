# OwlDomain.CommandLine.Abstractions

A package that contains the abstractions for the OwlDomain command-line engine.

> This project will eventually be in-lined into the [`OwlDomain.Console`](https://github.com/Owl-Domain/Console) project *(which does not exist yet)*, so prepare for this project to eventually be deprecated.

This project focuses on experimenting with a "zero boilerplate" approach to making command line tools.

*(In reality it's a "zero or the minimal amount of necessary boilerplate" approach but that isn't quite as catchy).*
